## STATUS

It's purpose is threefold: to offer 1) guidance to UChicago students about their course selections; 2) a service that could let students plan their courses with a balanced schedule; and 3)a service that could help students get into full classes.

 
This project is closed. Should there be further updates will depend on each group member.
